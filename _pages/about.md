I am a Machine Learning Researcher at Twitter, as well as PhD student working on Graph Neural Networks at Imperial College London and supervised by Prof. [Michael Bronstein](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UU3N6-UAAAAJ&hl=en). Before joining Twitter I was working at Fabula AI, which was then [acquired by Twitter](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/twitter-bags-deep-learning-talent-behind-london-startup-fabula-ai/) in June 2019. Previously, I completed an MPhil at the University of Cambridge and a BEng at Imperial College London, both in Computer Science. 

I am also the co-founder of [LeadTheFuture](https://leadthefuture.tech/), a non-profit mentoring organization and the largest merit-based STEM community in Italy. Today LeadTheFuture counts more than [150 mentors](https://leadthefuture.tech/i-nostri-mentor/) (engineers, researchers and entrepreneurs) and 500 selected mentees.
